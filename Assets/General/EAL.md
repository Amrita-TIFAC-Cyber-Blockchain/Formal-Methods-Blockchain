## CCEAL: Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level
**‚ÄçCommon Criteria** is a robust framework for evaluating and certifying the security features of IT products, with the **Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL)** serving as a crucial measure of security evaluation depth and rigor. Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation is a globally recognized framework and international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) that provides guidelines for independently assessing and certifying the security features of IT products. 

### Assurance Level
- **EAL1: Functionally tested**
- **EAL2: Structurally tested**
- **EAL3: Methodically tested and checked**
- **EAL4: Methodically designed, tested and reviewed**
- **EAL5: Semi-formally designed and tested**
- **EAL6: Semi-formally verified design and tested** <br/> 
  Green Hills Software's INTEGRITY-178B RTOS has been certified to EAL6.
- **EAL7: Formally verified design and tested** <br/> 
   The ProvenCore OS, developed by ProvenRun, has been certified to EAL7 in 2019 by the ANSSI. The Tenix Interactive Link Data Diode Device, the Fox-IT Fox Data Diode (one-way data communications device) and the Arbit Cyber Defence Systems Data Diode 10GbE claimed to have been evaluated at EAL7 augmented.
